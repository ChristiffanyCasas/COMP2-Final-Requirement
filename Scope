The proposed system aims to provide small business owners
with a comprehensive tool to monitor and analyze their sales and
expenses on a daily, weekly and quarterly basis. By utilizing
this system, business owners will have a better understanding of
the financial performance of their enterprise, allowing them to
make informed decisions and improve their overall success. The
system will include features such as daily and weekly sales
monitoring, daily and weekly expense tracking, net profit
calculation, comparison of highest and lowest sales, and
quarterly trend analysis. The quarterly trend analysis feature
will provide long-term insights into the business's performance
and help business owners make informed decisions. The system
will also calculate the standard deviation of the monthly sales
data to determine the business's sales volatility.
The system will exclude features such as inventory
tracking, purchase order management, and customer relationship
management. These functions are outside the scope of the
proposed system and will not be included. However, the system
will allow for manual or automatic data entry to track financial
transactions, which can be useful in maintaining the accuracy of
the data.

External factors that may impact the system include changes
in tax laws, economic conditions, and the availability of
internet connectivity. As tax laws and economic conditions may
influence a business's profitability, the system may need to be
updated to reflect these changes. Additionally, since the system
will rely on internet connectivity to access cloud storage,
network disruptions or connectivity issues may impact the
system's accessibility and reliability.
Overall, the proposed system has specific functions,
features, and processes that will aid small business owners in
monitoring their sales and expenses. While certain features will
be excluded, the system will provide valuable insights into a
business's performance over time. External factors such as tax
laws, economic conditions, and internet connectivity may impact
the system's effectiveness and will need to be considered.
