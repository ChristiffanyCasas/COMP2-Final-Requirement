According to studies(Bhatt S, 2023), a number of systems
with features comparable to the suggested tool are already in
use on a global scale. Several instances include:

1. An array of financial management tools, including
sales and spending monitoring, standard deviation
analysis, and quarterly trend analysis, are offered by
the well-known accounting program QuickBooks. Users
may create bespoke reports with QuickBooks, which also
offers predictive analytics features (Shweta and
Bottorff,2023).

2. Another accounting program with capabilities like
sales monitoring, spending tracking, and financial
reporting is Zoho Books. Standard deviation, trend
analysis, and the ability to create custom reports are
all included in Zoho Books. (IMTS Enterprise
Solutions,2021).

3. Xero is an online accounting program that has
functions including spending tracking, invoicing, and
bank reconciliation. Standard deviation and trend
analysis are also included in Xero, and customers may
create financial reports that are tailored to their
needs (Financials, 2020).
However, the provided system still offers a number of
distinct advantages over current options like QuickBooks, Zoho
Books, and Xero. The first thing about it is that it is created
especially for tracking sales and expenses, with an emphasis on
standard deviation and trend analysis, giving more in-depth
insights into financial data. Second, it is extremely flexible
and can provide reports and visualizations that are customized
to the user's needs. Lastly, it provides predictive analytics
capabilities that let businesses foresee future patterns and
take preventative action.
In general, this instrument can be the best option for
small businesses that are looking for a specialist financial
analysis and forecasting tool that might offer distinct benefits
over present methods.
